# Genie Parser

Genie is both a library framework and a test harness that facilitates rapid
development, encourages re-usability, and simplifies writing test automation. Bundled with the modular architecture of pyATS framework, Genie accelerates and simplifies test automation leveraging all the perks of the Python programming language in an object-oriented fashion.

This is a sub-component of Genie that parses the device output into a defined
data structure.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers to start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and has been available to the
general public since early 2018 through [Cisco DevNet].
